# Data-Visualization
The process of finding trends and correlations in our data by representing it pictorially is called Data Visualization. To perform data visualization in python, we can use various python data visualization modules such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc. In this project, The Complete Guide to Data Visualization in Python, I will discuss  how to work with some of these modules for data visualization in python and cover the following topics in detail.

The project used a dataset present in herberman.csv file which contains informaton about cancer patients survival status.
